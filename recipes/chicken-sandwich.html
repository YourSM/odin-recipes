<h2>Description</h3>
<p>This simple chicken sandwich recipe is a combination of the Popeyes and Chick-fil-a sandwiches with a hint of hot sauce! Why settle or one when you can have 2 in 1 whenever you want?</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h3>

<h3>Marinade:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 dash hot sauce, or to taste</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon dry ranch dressing mix (like Hidden Valley Ranch)</li>
    <li>4 (5 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
</ul>

<h3>Breading:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons cayenne pepper (Optional)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon dry ranch dressing mix</li>
</ul>

<h3>Wash:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
    <li>1/2 cup buttermilk</li>
    <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Rest:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>canola oil for frying</li>
    <li>4 soft hamburger buns, toasted and buttered</li>
    <li>6 tablespoons mayonnaise, or to taste</li>
    <li>12 dill pickle slices, or to taste</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Whisk buttermilk, salt, hot sauce, and ranch dressing mix together in a large bowl. Cut diagonal slits into the thick ends of chicken breasts and toss into marinade until well coated. Transfer to the refrigerator to marinate for 2 to 4 hours.</li></p>
<li><p>Meanwhile, make the breading: Mix flour, cornstarch, salt, pepper, cayenne, and ranch dressing mix together in a shallow dish.</li></p>
<li><p>Make the wash: Wash egg, buttermilk, and milk together in another bowl until combined</li></p>
<li><p>Use a fork to pull chicken from marinade, letting any excess drip off. Dip into the breading to coat both sides; shake off any excess. Dip into egg wash mixture to saturate surface; return to breading to coat, shake off excess, and repeat once more. Let sit on a wire rack to dry, at least 15 minutes.</li></p>
<li><p>Heat oil in a deep-fryer to between 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li></p>
<li><p>Fry chicken breasts in the hot oil until golden, crispy, and no longer pink in the centers, 4 to 5 minutes, flipping halfway through. Transfer to a plate topped with crinkled up aluminum foil to prevent bottoms from getting soggy.</li></p>
<li><p>Spread mayonnaise over hamburger bun halves. Stuff with pickles and chicken.</li></p>
</ol>

<h2>Special Notes</h2>
<p>You really want to do this with a smaller, flatter breast than the one I used in the video. The meat-to-crunchy coating ratio should be closer to 2-to-1 than 4-to-1.
<p>You can also pan-fry this in about 1 inch of oil in a cast iron skillet.</p>
